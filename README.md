# Hydropower Optimization

This project investigates optimization strategies for maximizing profits in **hydropower generation** by strategically planning water discharge and spillage across reservoirs. The case study focuses on *PowerCompany AB* operating four hydro plants over a 9-hour horizon, using both **linear programming (LP)** and **stochastic programming** approaches.

## Project Overview

* **Problem Type:** Linear & stochastic optimization
* **Context:** Hydropower production planning
* **Planning Horizon:** 9 hours
* **Key Features:**

  * Linear programming formulation with deterministic electricity prices
  * Sensitivity analysis of reservoir and discharge constraints
  * Consideration of future electricity prices beyond 9 hours
  * Stochastic programming to account for uncertain price scenarios

## Models

1. **Deterministic LP Model**

   * Maximizes profit using known hourly electricity prices
   * Achieves ~â‚¬1.203 billion optimal profit
   * Strategy: discharge during high-price hours, conserve water during low-price hours

2. **Extended LP Model (Future Prices)**

   * Incorporates value of selling stored water after the 9-hour horizon
   * Higher profits when future prices exceed immediate market prices

3. **Stochastic Programming Models**

   * **Expected Value (EV) Model:** average price scenario, profit ~â‚¬0.988 billion
   * **Two-Stage Recourse Model:** adaptive strategy, profit ~â‚¬1.021 billion
   * More robust performance across multiple pricing scenarios

## Results & Insights

* **Reservoir & Discharge Constraints:**

  * Relaxing minimum reservoir levels increases profit potential (e.g., +â‚¬31.15 million at Ã…hlen).
  * Tightening discharge limits reduces profitability (e.g., â€“â‚¬30.3 million at Forsen).
* **Capacity Utilization:**

  * Increasing Forsenâ€™s discharge capacity yields the highest marginal gains.
* **Price Sensitivity:**

  * Higher future electricity prices incentivize water conservation.
* **Uncertainty Handling:**

  * Stochastic models trade off some profit for robustness under market volatility.
